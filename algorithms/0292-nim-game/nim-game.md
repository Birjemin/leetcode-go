## 问题
You are playing the following Nim Game with your friend: There is a heap of stones on the table, each time one of you take turns to remove 1 to 3 stones. The one who removes the last stone will be the winner. You will take the first turn to remove the stones.

Both of you are very clever and have optimal strategies for the game. Write a function to determine whether you can win the game given the number of stones in the heap.

Example:
```
Input: 4
Output: false 
Explanation: If there are 4 stones in the heap, then you will never win the game;
             No matter 1, 2, or 3 stones you remove, the last stone will always be 
             removed by your friend.
```

## 分析
你和你的朋友，两个人一起玩 Nim 游戏：桌子上有一堆石头，每次你们轮流拿掉 1 - 3 块石头。 拿掉最后一块石头的人就是获胜者。你作为先手。

想到了递归，树

## 最高分
```golang
func canWinNim(n int) bool {
	return n%4 != 0
}
```

## 实现
```golang
func canWinNim(n int) bool {
	return n%4 != 0
}
```
